# ConcreteAI – AI Webpage for Concrete Strength Prediction

**ConcreteAI is an AI-powered webpage that predicts the compressive strength of concrete using a trained model.**

---

## Project Overview

**ConcreteAI** is a lightweight, browser-based AI webpage that predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on mix proportions.  
It uses a **trained model** (developed using Python) and implements the prediction logic in JavaScript for real-time results in the browser.  
The output is displayed in a **glowing result box** with a clean and modern AI-inspired design.

The project emphasizes **modern UI design** with:
- Black background  
- White bordered forms  
- Glowing result output  
- Clean, two-column layout for input data
